##### Description of the development process:

Planning: Begin by defining the app's requirements and functionality, including what tasks users can create and how they will interact with the app. Develop a basic wireframe or prototype of the user interface.

Front-end development: Use ReactJS to create the app's user interface. This may involve developing components such as a task list, task input form, and task update/delete buttons.

Back-end development: Use NodeJS to create a RESTful API that communicates with the front-end to perform CRUD operations on the task data. This may involve developing endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks in the database. Express was the Framework used along NodeJS.

Integration: Connect the front-end and back-end of the app. This may involve using a library such as Axios to send HTTP requests to the API, or using WebSockets to enable real-time updates to the task list.

Testing: Test the app to ensure that it works as expected and meets the defined requirements. This may involve manual testing and/or automated testing using tools such as Jest or Enzyme.

Deployment: Deploy the app to a server or hosting service, such as Netlify and Render, to make it accessible to users.

Overall, developing a CRUD to-do list app with ReactJS and NodeJS involves creating a user-friendly front-end interface, developing a back-end API to perform CRUD operations on task data, integrating the front-end and back-end, testing the app, and deploying it to a server or hosting service.
