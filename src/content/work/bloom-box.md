##### Spa Web Page

Planning: Begin by defining the spa web page requirements and functionality, including what services the spa offers, how users can book appointments, and how they will interact with the page. Develop a basic wireframe or prototype of the user interface.

Front-end development: Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the web page's user interface. This may involve developing pages for services, pricing, and location, as well as a booking form for users to schedule appointments.
