##### Real Estate Web page

Planning: Begin by defining the real estate web page requirements and functionality, including what information users can search for and how they will interact with the page. Develop a basic wireframe or prototype of the user interface.

Front-end development: Use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap 4 to create the web page's user interface. This may involve developing a search bar, a list or grid of properties, and property detail pages with images, descriptions, and features.
